# Phase 2 ‚Äì Decomposition Fix and Orchestrator Logging

## Summary
- Ensure decomposition outputs are `List<string>` and mapped to `ResearchTask`.
- Add orchestrator logs for decomposition, subtask enqueue, and task completion.

## Changes
- `TaskAnalyzerAgent.DecomposeTask` now:
  - Uses `WithStructuredOutputRetry<List<string>>` for the primary path.
  - Falls back to `List<Dictionary<string,string>>` to tolerate alternative LLM formats.
  - Returns `List<ResearchTask>` created from descriptions.
- `ResearchOrchestrator.ProcessSingleTask` now logs:
  - Start of processing
  - Subtask decomposition and enqueue
  - Task completion and confidence
  - Failures

## Architecture/Execution Flow Impact
- Decomposition remains LLM-only but more robust to model variance.
- Orchestrator visibility improved for monitoring and debugging.
- No API surface changes; tasks are still pushed to `_taskQueue` with `ParentTaskId` set.

## How to Test

### Build and run tests
```bash
cd ResearchAgentNetwork
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

### Manual run
```bash
dotnet run --project ResearchAgentNetwork.ConsoleApp
```
- Observe logs:
  - "‚û°Ô∏è Processing task" on start
  - "üß© Decomposed into N subtasks" when decomposition occurs
  - "‚Ü≥ Enqueued subtask ..." for each child
  - "‚úÖ Completed task ..." on completion

### Expected Results
- Complex tasks decompose into 3‚Äì5 subtasks and are enqueued.
- Atomic tasks skip decomposition and execute directly.
- The console shows clear lifecycle logs.

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
- Inject a `GetChildren` accessor into `AggregatorAgent` to enable parent aggregation once children complete.
